Description:
You are responsible for writing a program that will simulate logging into a businessâ€™s shipping
accounts software. Once logged in your program will display the current costs of shipping x
amount of items. Based on the number of items shipped, the cost to ship each item will vary.
Once the cost to ship an item is set, your program will calculate the cost of shipping the entire
order. Upon confirmation of the order, your program will place the order and prepare the
shipment.
